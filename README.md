# microservices

This repository contains a demo of a sample microservices-based architecture. The idea of this demo is to easily set up and play around with concepts such as CI/CD deployment techniques, service meshes, service discovery, operational dashboards, etc.

The current implementation supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Refer each of the subfolders (`gcp/`, `aws/`) for additional details on how to deploy.
